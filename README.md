Create Project 3 for DIG-6647 at UCF

This project was built using assistance from GitHub Copilot.

AI was particularly used to build the framework for the stats system and how I could implement unique scenarios and life events with their own stat deltas, with ease of expansion in mind. AI was also used to script out the losing state and how I could generate a brief overview of the players' run based on the final values of each stat.

All 80+ unique events and player summaries were written by myself. All UI elements and implementation in Unity were also done without AI assistance.
